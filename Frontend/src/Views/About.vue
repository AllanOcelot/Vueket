      <p>This is just a simple project showing off a 'Real World' use of Vue3 paired with a node middleware and a Pocketbase backend.</p>
      <p>This is purely for fun and learning, nothing more.</p>
      <p>I do kind of like the idea though, so who know's if I get enough time might launch it.</p>
