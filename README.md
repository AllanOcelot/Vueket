# Vuket
Vueket is a simple example application built with Vue3 ( frontend ) , Node ( Middleware ), Pocketbase ( Backend ).

It's meant to serve as a learning project for myself ( and hopefully others ) on getting started with Pocketbase for "Real World" applications.

Rather than another "To-Do" list, the example app is a "Bounty" system for video games.


# MVP Goals
- Vue3 frontend with pages ( Home , Bounties , Register, Sign up )
- Node Middleware talking to the Pocketbase backend
- Pocketbase instance, to manage data ( Done in a secure way)

# Notes
- Pocketbase EXE is NOT included in this repo. You should download the latest stable release from Pocketbase, and extract it to /Pocketbase to enable functionality.

# Useful scripts
 - /pocketbase -> .pocketbase serve 
 - /middleware -> npm run start
 - /frontend   -> npm run dev




This project is the lowest priority of my hobby projects, so likely won't be done for some time.
